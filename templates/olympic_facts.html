            The first Olympic Games took place in the 8th century B.C. in Olympia, Greece. 
            Held every four years, in honor of the Greek God Zeus, records show the Ancient 
            Olympic Games began in 776 BC in Olympia and weren't halted until 394 AD.  Then, 
            in the 4th century A.D., all pagan festivals were banned by Emperor Theodosius I 
            and the Olympics were no more.

            However, the athletic tradition was resurrected about 1500 years later.
            The first modern Olympics were held in 1896 in Greece.
            The Modern Olympic Games are based on the Olympic Games of Ancient Greece.

            The prize for event winners in the Ancient Olympics was an olive branch wreath.
            Since the 1904 Olympics, medals have been awarded in each event, with gold medals 
            for first place, silver for second and bronze for third.

            The Olympic motto is "Citius, Altius, Fortius", which is Latin for "Faster, Higher, Stronger". 
            It was proposed by Pierre de Coubertin upon the creation of the International Olympic Committee in 1894.

                The Olympic flame is lit at Olympia in Greece every two years (Summer and Winter Olympics) 
                before it journeys to the next host nation where it is paraded around until the lighting 
                of the Olympic Cauldron at the opening ceremony.
            </p> 
            <p>
                The Olympic torch is lit the old-fashioned way in an ancient ceremony at the temple of Hera, 
                in Greece: Actresses, wearing costumes of Greek priestesses, use a parabolic mirror and sun rays 
                to kindle the torch.
            </p> 
            <p>
                From there, the torch starts its relay to the host city: It is usually carried by runners, 
                but it has traveled on a boat, on an airplane (and the Concorde), on horseback, on the back 
                of a camel, via radio signal, underwater, and in a canoe.
            </p>
            <p>
                The relay torch and the Olympic flame are supposed to burn during the whole event. In case 
                the flame goes out, it can only be reignited with a backup flame, which has been lit in Greece 
                as well, and with never a regular lighter!
            </p> 
            <p>
                The unlit Olympic torch has also been taken to space several times.

                The five rings of the Olympic symbol – designed by Baron Pierre de Coubertin, co-founder 
                of the modern Olympic Games – represent the five inhabited continents of the world 
                (Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and the Americas), they are linked together in friendship.
            </p>

            <p>
                The six colors – blue,  yellow,  black,  green,  red, and the  white background – were 
                chosen because every nation’s flag contains at least one of them.

            Since the opening of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, the international sports 
            competition has only been canceled three times: once during World War I (1916) and twice 
            during World War II (1940, 1944). Until the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, which postponed the 
            Summer Olympic games for a year, the Olympics weathered politically charged boycotts and 
            two separate terrorist attacks without being canceled or postponed during peacetime.

            The 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to be held in Tokyo, Japan between 24 July 
            and 9 August 2020, were rescheduled for 23 July to 8 August 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 
            pandemic. The Games of the XXXII Olympiad will keep the name Tokyo 2020 for marketing and 
            branding purposes despite being held in 2021.

            SINCE WHEN HAVE THE SUMMER AND WINTER GAMES NO LONGER BEEN HELD IN THE SAME YEAR?

            At its 1986 Session in Lausanne, the IOC decided to introduce this change. 
            From 1924 to 1992, the Summer and Winter Games were each held in the same year, every four years. 
            This four years period is called the "Olympiad". The last Summer and Winter Games held in the same 
            year were in Barcelona (Summer) and Albertville (Winter) in 1992. Since then, the Summer and Winter 
            Games are each still held every four years but the Summer Games are celebrated during the first year 
            of an Olympiad and the Winter Games held in the third year.

            The Olympic Games have been hosted by 23 different countries.
            The 2012 London Games were the first Olympics in which all participating countries sent female athletes.
